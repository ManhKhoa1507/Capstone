**Cyber-attack classification in the network traffic database using NSL-KDD dataset**

Classification is the process of dividing the data elements into specific classes based on their values. It is a type of supervised learning which means data are labelled. This project “Cyber-attack classification in the network traffic database” uses commonly used machine learning classification algorithms to solve the problem by identifying the normal network traffics and attack classes. We know there are 5 different classes to KDD dataset so this comes under the classification problem where classification algorithms can be used to identify different classes based on attributes. In this report, I will discuss the various classification algorithms like logistic regression, naive bayes, decision trees, random forests and many more. The performance of models will be evaluated with different performance measures such as accuracy, precision and recall. In addition, I will be comparing their performance and time complexity. I am using Macintosh with 2.9 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 CPU and 16 GB RAM.
